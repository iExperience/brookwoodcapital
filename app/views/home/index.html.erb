          Brookwood Capital focuses on high potential, purpose driven companies in the early stages of their growth cycle. Start ups? Yes. Tech start ups? Not always.
        </p>
        <p class="big">
          We invest in companies that delight and inspire not just their customers but also our team. While we appreciate the importance of technology in all forms, we are equally as impressed by physical products and brick and mortar operations.

          We provide what small businesses need to achieve real growth. Often, this involves funding money but it’s also about expert mentorship, technical knowledge, and the creation of synergies.
        </p>
        <p class="big">
          Ultimately, we believe in community. We are building a network of people, businesses and customers that support each other, and grow together. We operate in markets categorised by intimacy rather than massive size and we believe in utilizing this to improve results.

          We recognise that radical business growth is about more than revenue and profit - it’s about building teams, honing vision, and executing smart rather than hard. We believe that many small businesses forget about these things in the rush for users, and funding.
