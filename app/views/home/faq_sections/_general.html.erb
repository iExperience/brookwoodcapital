          <p>"iXperience was hands down the best summer of my life. It's more than just a startup founded by passionate young professionals; it's an experience that every zealous college student should seek out. I intended to come to Cape Town for eight weeks and leave with the knowledge of a new coding language. Instead, I adopted an entirely new lifestyle and outlook on life. I learned a new programming language, worked for a non-profit, went skydiving, jumped off the tallest bungee bridge in the world, dove with great white sharks, attempted surfing, rode an elephant, and came away with so much more."</p>
